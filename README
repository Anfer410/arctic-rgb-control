# Arctic RGB Control Master

This is a python code to replace https://support.arctic.de/rgb-controller, 

Original software is only available for windows, so I took a stab at trying to make it more OS agnostic.


In order to run this code you need to get CH431SER driver ->  best from here https://github.com/juliagoda/CH341SER


In order to get device id run ```ls /dev``` usualy it will be ttyUSBx where x is the number.

This is still in development.


Python 3.11.2

# Run
```python -m venv arctic-rgb
source arctic-rgb/bin/activate
python -m pip -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

Go to web browser and access http://localhost:9000
